# Universal Authenticator Library (UAL)

## Usage (Authenticator Developer)

A developer that wishes to add support for their authenticator to UAL must implement 2 classes. An `Authenticator` and a `User`.

The `Authenticator` class represents the Button that will (potentially) be rendered on the screen and the business logic around logging.

Logging in returns 1 or more `User` objects. A `User` object provides the ability for a Dapp developer to request the Dapp User to sign a transaction using whichever authentication provider they selected when logging in.
