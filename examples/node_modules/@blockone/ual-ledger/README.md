# Authenticator for Ledger

This authenticator is meant to be used with [Universal Authenticator Library](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library)

## Getting Started

  `yarn add @blockone/ual-ledger`

#### Dependencies

* You must have the [eos app](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008913653) installed on your ledger device. You can download it to your device using [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live), if you do not already have it.

* Use one of the UAL renderers below.

  * React - `@blockone/universal-authenticator-library-react`

  * Vanillajs - `@blockone/universal-authenticator-library-js`

* An `HTTPS` connection is required

* Enable `Arbitrary Data` in the settings of your eos app


#### Basic Usage with React

```

import { Ledger } from '@blockone/ual-ledger'
import { UALProvider, withUAL } from '@blockone/universal-authenticator-library-react'

const exampleNet = {
  chainId: '',
  rpcEndpoints: [{
    protocol: '',
    host: '',
    port: '',
  }]
}

const App = (props) => <div>{JSON.stringify(props.ual)}</div>
const AppWithUAL = withUAL(App)

const ledger = new Ledger([exampleNet])

<UALProvider chains={[exampleNet]} authenticators={[ledger]}>
  <AppWithUAL />
</UALProvider>
```
    
#### Known Limitations
** The eos app was written by a member of the eos community and only supports certain actions. View here for more information https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-eos/.
** This libary has only been tested with the `Ledger Nano S`.
